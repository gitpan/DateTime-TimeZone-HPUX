Revision history for DateTime-TimeZone-HPUX

1.04    2009-11-18 19:05:00 +0100 (MET)
        Fixing my local YAML.pm to make Module::Build create an UTF-8 valid
          META.yml. Hopefully Adam K. will soon release my fix.
        Build.PL: dropped Makefile.PL as suggested by ANDK in RT#51589.
        Updated README.
        Build.PL: added 'dynamic_config' for META.yml
        Bumped DateTime::TimeZone requirement to the latest (1.05).

1.03    2009-11-12 19:10:00 +0100 (MET)
        Bumped version number.
        Bumped DateTime::TimeZone requirement to the latest (1.04).
        Announcing unmaintained mode as I won't have access to an HP-UX system
          after 2009-11-30, so this is probably the last release.

1.02_91 2009-11-06 21:32:00 +0100 (MET)
        Improved failure capture in local-METDST.t.
        Made Java bin path detection result available for tests.
        Renamed @DateTime::TimeZone::HPUX::JAVA_PATHS to @JAVA_HOMES.

1.02_90 2009-11-05 20:35:00 +0100 (MET)
        Added DateTime::TimeZone to build_requires.
        Increased DateTime::TimeZone requirement to the latest version (0.99).
        JavaMap.PL: improved diagnostics.
        More release tests in t/version.t.
        Marked tests local-METDST.t as TODO as they are failing on many
          non-HPUX platforms and this test makes the assumption to be able to
          fake the HP-UX environment.
        Added built-in mappings for CST6CDT#Indiana, EST5EDT#Indiana,
          MXST6MXDT, MXST6MXDT#Mexico, AST4ADT#Canada, CSM6CDM,
          CSM6CDM#Mexico, MSM7MDM#Mexico, NST3:30NDT#Canada, PSM8PDM,
          PST8PDT#Mexico, and WST-8WDT.
        t/local-java.t is now run if JAVA_HOME is set.

1.02    2009-10-15 19:55:00 +0200 (METDST)
        JavaMap.PL: fixed DefaultMap loading. Now tests pass on Win32 too.

1.01    2009-10-15 19:33:00 +0200 (METDST)
        Renammed private module DT::TZ::HPUX::JavaMap to DT::TZ::HPUX::Map.
        Added POD to DT::TZ::HPUX::Map.
        Improved documentation.
        Fixed POD coverage test.
        Fixed my build environment to get an UTF-8 META.yml.

1.00    2009-10-14 19:37:00 +0200 (METDST)
        Now using Java to retrieve an hopefully complete mapping of tztab(4)
          names to Olson DB. See the 'Implementation' section in
          DateTime::TimeZone::HPUX for details.
        Added JavaMap.PL which extracts the mapping from the JRE at module
          build time. A default map is bundled in case no JRE is found.
        In extreme cases, Java may be called at runtime for timezones which
          were not known at build time.
        Added code to DT::TZ::HPUX to provide a TimeZone factory interface.
        This version was released on CPAN but not indexed due to an UTF-8
          problem in META.yml (due to bug #25434 in the YAML module for
          which I posted a patch 2 months ago). 

0.09    2009-05-24
        Changed tests:
        - removed t/boilerplate.t (used only to help the author to fix
          Module::Starter generated content)
        - t/local-METDST.t: moved environment setting to a BEGIN block
          (this may fix CPAN testers failures on some perls)
        Not released on CPAN.

0.08    2009-05-13 16:15:00 +0200 (METDST)
        Fixed issue with _FromEtcTimeZone on HP-UX.
        Reporting result with diag() in t/local-*.t.
        Added tests to check that local TZ can be rebuilt from name.

0.07    2009-05-10 14:21:21 +0200 (METDST)
        Fixed pod to make pod-coverage.t pass.
        Added tests.
        Removed DateTime from dependencies.

0.06    2009-05-07 19:39:05 +0200 (METDST)
        Fixed t/boilerplate.t.

0.05    2009-05-07 11:26:28 +0200 (METDST)
        Switching to Module::Build from Module::Install due to archive
        creation problems on Win32. See http://use.perl.org/~bart/journal/38127
        This should fix CPAN indexing.

0.04    2009-04-22 11:45:56 +0200 (METDST)
        Documentation fixes.

0.03    2009-04-21 19:23:53 +0200 (METDST)
        Removed the special case for "GMT+x" as it does not match the OS behavior.

0.02    2009-04-21 18:59:22 +0200 (METDST)
        Added parsing of GMT based offset such as "GMT+3" => +0300.
        Fixed parsing of unknown offset such as "SAT4" => -0400.

0.01    2009-04-21 15:02:33 +0200 (METDST)
        First version, released on an unsuspecting world.
